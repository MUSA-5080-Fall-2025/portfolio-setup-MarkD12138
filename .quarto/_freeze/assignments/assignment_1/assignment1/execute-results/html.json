The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Assignments\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `assignments/assignment_1/` folder structure.

This means that decisions based on such data may carry systematic bias. For instance, counties with higher MOE may have lower true median incomes that go undetected, leading to missed opportunities for support or resource allocation. This uncertainty may arise because many lower-income residents in these counties are harder to reach or less likely to participate in surveys.\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\nselected_counties <- reliability_sort %>%\n  filter(str_detect(NAME, \"Philadelphia\") | str_detect(NAME, \"Warren\")) %>%\n  select(NAME,          \n         median_incomeE,\n         MOE,\n         re_categories)\n\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\nkable(selected_counties, \n      align = c(\"l\",\"l\",\"l\",\"l\"),\n      col.names = c(\"County\", \"Medain Income\", \"MOE(%)\", \"Reliability Category\"),\n      caption = \"Two Selected Counties\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Two Selected Counties\n\n|County       |Medain Income |MOE(%)   |Reliability Category |\n|:------------|:-------------|:--------|:--------------------|\n|Warren       |57925         |5.187743 |Moderate Confidence  |\n|Philadelphia |57537         |1.376506 |High Confidence      |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Comment on the output:** Warren and Philadelphia are selected that represent different reliability levels to do further analysis in tract-level study.\n\n## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics\n\n**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: tract level\n- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)\n- Use the same state and year as before\n- Output format: wide\n- **Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names.

However, they show much lower average White population share and higher average Black and Hispanic population shares. This suggests that tracts with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic residents tend to have less reliable estimated data. One likely explanation is that these communities face structural challenges in survey data collection, including lower response rates and higher nonresponse bias. Such challenges may stem from factors such as longer work hours, higher population mobility, and language or cultural barriers among immigrant households, which are caused by historical reasons.\n\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\n**Overall Pattern Identification**: Overall, MOE values are generally within acceptable bounds at the county level, indicating good reliability for income estimates. But uncertainty is pervasive at the tract level: every tract in two selected counties has at least one racial subgroup with MOE > 15%, and “high-severity” tracts (where multiple subgroups exceed the threshold) are common. These tracts with severe MOE issues exhibit markedly lower average White share and higher Black and Hispanic shares.\n\n**Equity Assessment**: Because MOE is systematically larger in tracts with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic residents, algorithms that rely on these estimates might have issues of mis-classification and under-allocation of resources. Counties and neighborhoods with greater shares of Black and Hispanic populations, which potentially have lower true median incomes, are more likely to be labeled with uncertain data and thus underserved, amplifying pre-existing inequities.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis**: Firstly, smaller subgroup of data at the tract scale naturally owns a smaller sample size, and smaller samples tends to have higher uncertainty. Moreover, in these communities with greater shares of Black and Hispanic residents, due to historical reasons, the residents might face difficulties including language and cultural barriers, time constraints from multiple jobs or long shifts. These difficulties might lead to lower response rates and higher nonresponse bias, raising the issue of MOE and uncertainty of data.\n\n**Strategic Recommendations**: For tracts with lower data reliability (MOE exceeds 15%), the data should not be used directly for algorithmic decision-making; instead, these cases should be referred for manual review. In the long term, efforts should focus on improving data precision in these areas to enhance reliability and, simultaneously, refining algorithms to apply adjusted weighting for high-MOE regions.

However, for any counties with low confidence data, these estimates should not be used directly for algorithmic decision-making. Instead, manual review and additional surveys should be implemented to improve the reliability of the data before it is used to inform decisions.\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n1. How have county and tract level MOE values changed over time when using ACS data from different years? Can we observe a decreasing trend in MOE, indicating that population and median income estimates are becoming more reliable over times?\n\n2. How do MOE patterns vary across states, and is there a relationship between state-level economic indicators (e.g., GDP per capita) and the reliability of ACS data? Are states with stronger economies associated with lower MOE values and therefore more reliable data?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on 2025/9/26\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version 4.5.1\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: https://musa-5080-fall-2025.github.io/portfolio-setup-MarkD12138/assignments/assignment_1/assignment1.html\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\nThis analysis focuses only on Pennsylvania counties as a case study, so the results may not fully represent national patterns. Additionally, I selected two example counties—one with high confidence and one with moderate confidence—to illustrate algorithmic decision-making implications. This selection is useful for demonstration but also limits the generalizability of the findings.\n\n**Limitations:**\nThis analysis only uses data from Pennsylvania, which may not represent patterns across the entire U.S. Additionally, the analysis focuses on two selected counties, which limits the generalizability of the findings.\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
