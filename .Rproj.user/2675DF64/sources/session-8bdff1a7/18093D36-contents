## Key Concepts Learned
- Why this matters: 1. Summary statistics can hide critical patterns 2. Outliers may represent important communities 3. Relationships arenâ€™t always linear 4.	Visual inspection reveals data quality issues
- Unreliable estimates are widely use, causing poor policy decisions
- Grammar of Graphics principles: 1. Data 2. Aesthetics 3. Geometries 4. Visual
- Aes is not for color and visuals and Aes is about variables mapping
- We should report the corresponding MOEs of ACS estimates and provide context for unreliability

## Coding Techniques
- left_join(): Keep all rows from left dataset
- right_join(): Keep all rows from right dataset
- inner_join(): Keep only rows that match in both
- full_join(): Keep all rows from both datasets
- 
- Aes is not for color and visuals and Aes is about variables mapping
- Regex can ignore cases (ignore.case = TRUE)


## Connections to Policy
- Most of planners are not repoting the MOEs in their decision
- Data-driven policy making need to consider the MOEs and report them in document

## Reflection
- Understand the responsibility for planners of using data with uncertainty in decision making
