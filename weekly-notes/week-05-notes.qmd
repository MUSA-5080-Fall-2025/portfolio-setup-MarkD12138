## Key Concepts Learned
- Real Policy Questions Need Spatial Answers
- In spatial analysis, geographic bias in algorithms are existed
- Vector Data vs Raster Data

- sf Package
- st_filter(), st_intersects(), st_touches(), st_within()
- ".predicate" is for setting different relationship
- Spatial Join
- Intersection


## Connections to Policy
- Policy analysis and implication are based on spatial analysis


## Reflection
- Recite the code for different spatial operation
